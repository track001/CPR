# CPR Instructions

This program provides step-by-step instructions for performing CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) on an adult or child. It guides you through the necessary actions to take in order to administer compressions and rescue breaths.

## Instructions

1. Check the scene to ensure it's safe.
2. Call 911 or your local emergency number for help.
3. Place the person on their back on a firm surface.
4. Check for a response (tap and shout).
5. If unresponsive, open the airway (tilt head, lift chin).
6. Check for normal breathing (look, listen, feel) for no more than 10 seconds.

### Adult CPR

7. If not breathing normally, give rescue breaths.
   - To give rescue breaths to an adult:
     - Pinch the person's nose closed.
     - Take a normal breath and cover the person's mouth with yours, making a seal.
     - Give two breaths, each lasting about 1 second, while watching for the chest to rise.
8. Locate the center of the person's chest, interlace hands, and perform compressions.
9. Compress hard and fast at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.
10. Allow the chest to recoil fully between compressions.
11. Give two rescue breaths after every 30 compressions.

### Child CPR

7. If not breathing normally, give rescue breaths.
   - To give rescue breaths to a child:
     - Pinch the person's nose closed.
     - Take a normal breath and cover the child's mouth and nose with yours, making a seal.
     - Give two breaths, each lasting about 1 second, while watching for the chest to rise.
8. Locate the lower half of the sternum, and perform compressions using one or two hands.
9. Compress at a depth of about 2 inches (5 cm) for children.
10. Compress at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.
11. Allow the chest to recoil fully between compressions.
12. Give two rescue breaths after every 15 compressions.
